### Bootstrap

#### What is Bootstrap

```
Bootstrap is a CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

Bootsrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap.
```

> For more information, this [link](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/)

#### How to install and use it?

1. If you are using npm, type to install react-bootstrap
```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

2. Import the css file from the installed bootstrap

```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

> You only need to import the bootstrap `.css` file only once in your project. If you don't install the `.css` file, the styling will not be working.

3. Import the component that you want to utilize from bootstrap. In this case, I am importing Button from `react-bootstrap`.

```
import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';
```

You can check out more various components from [this link](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/)

4. You can add a button with design using just one line of code.
```
<Button variant='info'>Test</Button>
```

If you want to change the design, you can add change `variant`.
<p align='center'><img src='./images/bootstrap_btn1.jpg' /></p>

In bootstrap, you will use `className` to change the styling, not the `css` file that you made.

> There are a lot of other functions than variant. You need to Google it.

4. Then this button will be added in your websitev

<p align='center'><img src='./images/bootstrap_btn.jpg' /></p>
