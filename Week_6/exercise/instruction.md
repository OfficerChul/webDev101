# Exercise Instruction

## ðŸ”” Goal

Practice for loop and if statement. <br />
You will make a program which builds four different types of pyramids. <br />

There are four different types of pyramids.

 You will buil these pyramids with star (asterisk) by using for loop and if statement. <br />
 ### Conditions
 - If the `input` is 1, you will build the first pyramid.
 - If the `input` is 2, you will build the second pyramid.
 - If the `input` is 3, you will build the third pyramid.
 - If the `input` is 4, you will build the fourth pyramid.
 - Level can be any integer value which is greater than 2, such as 3, 6, 7...
 - You may have two for loops inside one for outer for loop for pyramid 3 and pyramid 4
*Hint: You should use nested for loop

## ðŸ“‘ Instruction

1. Make a directory called `week_6`
2. Create a `JavaScript` file which is called `build_pyramids.js`
2. Write a JavaScript code which can build 4 pyramids.
